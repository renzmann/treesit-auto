Automatically install and use tree-sitter major modes in Emacs 29+.  If the
tree-sitter version can't be used, fall back to the original major mode.

* Features
Each of these behaviors are configurable and documented under the
"Configuration" section.  By activating =global-treesit-auto-mode=, Emacs will:

+ Automatically switch to =<name>-ts-mode= when the grammar for =<name>= is installed
+ Stick with =<name>-mode= if the grammar isn't installed
+ (Optional) automatically install a grammar before opening a compatible file
  type

There is also a convenience function =M-x treesit-auto-install-all=, which will
install all of the maintained and compatible grammars.

* Installation
~treesit-auto~ is available from [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]].  After following [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][their setup]], you can
use your preferred package manager.  If that's the default =package.el=, simply
=M-x package-refresh-contents= and then

#+begin_example
M-x package-install RET treesit-auto
#+end_example

If you want a local clone of the repository, rather than just a copy of the
source, you might instead use =package-vc-install=

#+begin_src example
M-x package-vc-install RET https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto.git
#+end_src

Then, in your Emacs configuration file (=~/.emacs.d/init.el=),

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package treesit-auto
    :config
    (global-treesit-auto-mode))
#+end_src

There are some nifty things you might want to enable, though, which are covered
in the "Configuration" section below.

* What this package does
Emacs 29, while featuring =treesit.el= and a convenient
=treesit-install-language-grammar=, [[https://archive.casouri.cc/note/2023/tree-sitter-in-emacs-29/index.html][will not feature an intelligent way to choose]]
between a default mode, such as =python-mode=, and its tree-sitter enhanced
version, =python-ts-mode=.  This package attempts to remedy that by adjusting the
=major-mode-remap-alist= and =treesit-language-source-alist= variables in order to
get the following behavior:

*1. If the grammar is installed, then switch to the appropriate tree-sitter mode:*

In this case, assuming we open a Python buffer, and the [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python][Python tree-sitter
grammar]] is installed, then Emacs will use =python-ts-mode= instead of
=python-mode=.

*2. The grammar is NOT installed and treesit-auto-install is non-nil:*

When the grammar is not installed and ~treesit-auto-install~ is t, then upon
activating any major mode that has a corresponding tree-sitter mode, the grammar
will be downloaded and compiled using ~treesit-install-language-grammar~.  Emacs
will then activate the tree-sitter major mode for that buffer.

~prompt~ is like t, except a message will be displayed in the echo area asking
for a yes/no response before attempting the installation.

As an example for both cases: if I visit a Python file and didn't already have
the grammar installed, I wind up with an installed grammar and a buffer using
~python-ts-mode~.

Otherwise, when ~treesit-auto-install~ is nil, it will try to fall back to
another major mode as described in the following two rules.

*3. If the grammar is NOT installed, and the user has specified a fallback*

The customizable variable =treesit-auto-fallback-alist= lets you pick the fallback
modes by name.  For instance, if we apply this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'treesit-auto-fallback-alist '(toml-ts-mode . conf-toml-mode))
#+end_src

Then, when the TOML grammar is missing, Emacs will use =conf-toml-mode=, instead
of trying to fall back to =toml-mode=.

*4. All other cases...*

This is the most general case, where the grammar is not installed,
~treesit-auto-install~ is nil, no fallback mode is specified in
~treesit-auto-fallback-alist~, and an similarly named base mode exists.  Here,
~treesit-auto~ will switch to the non-tree-sitter major mode sharing a common
prefix.

For example, if the Go tree-sitter grammar is not installed, but we have
installed [[https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el][go-mode]], then Emacs will use that instead of =go-ts-mode=, since they
share the same =go-= prefix.

* Configuration
If you have modified =treesit-language-source-alist= through =setq=, then it is
recommended to put any configuration of this package AFTER that =setq=.

** Automatically install grammars if they are missing
The =treesit-auto-install= variable controls whether a grammar should be installed
automatically when activating a major mode compatible with tree-sitter.

1. =nil=, the default, means =treesit-auto= won't try to install anything, and will
   rely on the fallback logic outlined above
2. =t= means =treesit-auto= should always try to clone and install a grammar when
   missing
3. ~prompt~ will cause a yes/no prompt to appear in the minibuffer before
   attempting installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq treesit-auto-install 'prompt)
#+end_src

Then, supposing I don't have =libtree-sitter-python.so= (or its mac/Windows
equivalent) under =~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter= (or anywhere else in
=treesit-extra-load-path=), visiting a Python file or calling =M-x python-ts-mode=
will generate this prompt:

#+begin_example
  Tree-sitter grammar for python is missing.  Would you like to install it from https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python? (yes/no)
#+end_example

Responding with "yes" will use =treesit-install-langauge-grammar= to go fetch and
compile the missing grammar.

The other function that respects this variable is =treesit-auto-install-all=.
When =treesit-auto-install= is t, using =M-x treesit-auto-install-all= will skip all
prompts.  Otherwise, it will ask before attempting the installation.

** When major mode names don't match
Not all default major modes make sense to bump up to a similar tree-sitter mode.
For example, when /I/ open a =.sh= file, my intent is nearly always to use it with
Bash.  This is not the case for everyone, though, so by default this package
will not replace =sh-mode= with =bash-ts-mode=.  If you do want such a remap, simply
include a line like this before calling =treesit-auto-apply-remap=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'treesit-auto-fallback-alist '(bash-ts-mode . sh-mode))
#+end_src

** Keep track of your hooks
This package does not modify any of your major mode hooks.  That is, if you have
functions in =python-mode-hook=, but not in =python-ts-mode-hook=, then your hook
from =python-mode= will not be applied, assuming =python-ts-mode= is what gets
loaded.  For major modes in which this is a concern, the current recommendation
is to address this as part of your configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq rust-ts-mode-hook rust-mode-hook)
#+end_src

Some modes have a shared base, such as =python-ts-mode= and =python-mode= both
deriving from =python-base-mode=.  For these languages, you can opt to hook into
=python-base-mode-hook= instead of explicitly setting the tree-sitter mode's hook.

** Full example
This is how I configure =treesit-auto= for my own personal use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package treesit-auto
      :demand t
      :config
      (add-to-list 'treesit-auto-fallback-alist '(bash-ts-mode . sh-mode))
      (setq treesit-auto-install 'prompt)
      (global-treesit-auto-mode))
#+end_src

* Caveats
This package is, admittedly, a hack.  =treesit.el= provides an excellent
foundation to incremental source code parsing for Emacs 29, and over time that
foundation /will/ expand into an improved core editing experience.  With that in
mind, I fully expect this package to eventually be obsolesced by the default
options in Emacs 30 and beyond.  That does not preclude us from adding a few
quality of life improvements to Emacs 29, though, and so it still seems prudent
to have this plugin available in the meantime.

* Contributing
Bug reports, feature requests, and contributions are most welcome.  Even though
this is a small project, there is always room for improvement.  I also
appreciate "nitpicky" contributions, such as formatting, conventions, variable
naming, code simplification, and improvements to language in documentation.

Issues are tracked on [[https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto/issues][GitHub]], which is also where patches and pull requests
should be submitted.
